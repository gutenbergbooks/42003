<p class="ac">186. FLEET STREET.</p>

  <p>PLAIN SERMONS. By the late REV. EDWARD BLENCOWE. 3 vols., fcap. 8vo.,
  cloth, 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> Each sold separately.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Their style is simple; the sentences are not artfully constructed:
  and there is an utter absence of all attempt at rhetoric. The language is
  plain Saxon language, from which 'the men on the wall' can easily gather
  what it most concerns them to know.</p>

  <p>"Again, the range of thought is not high and difficult, but level and
  easy for the wayfaring man to follow. It is quite evident that the
  author's mind was able and cultivated; yet, as a teacher to men of low
  estate, he makes no display of eloquence or argument.</p>

  <p>"In the statements of Christian doctrine, the reality of Mr.
  Blencowe's mind is very striking. There is a strength and a warmth and a
  life in his mention of the great truths of the Gospel, which show that he
  spoke from the heart, and that, like the Apostle of old, he could
  say,&mdash;'I believe, and therefore have I spoken.'</p>

  <p>"His affectionateness too is no less conspicuous; this is shown in the
  gentle, earnest, kind-hearted tone of every Sermon in the book. There is
  no scolding, no asperity of language, not irritation of manner about
  them. At the same time there is no over-strained tenderness, nor
  affectation of endearment; but there is a considerate, serious concern
  about the peculiar sins and temptations of the people committed to his
  charge, and a hearty desire and determined effort for their
  salvation."&mdash;<i>Theologian.</i></p>

  <p>"Simple, intelligible, and affectionate."&mdash;<i>Church and State
  Gazette.</i></p>

  <p>"Very stirring and practical."&mdash;<i>Christian
  Remembrancer.</i></p>

  <p>SERMONS ON THE DOCTRINES and the MEANS OF GRACE, and on the SEVEN
  WORDS FROM THE CROSS. By GEORGE TREVOR, M.A., Canon of York. 12mo.,
  cloth, 6<i>s.</i></p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"A volume of excellent, sound sermons, admirably suited to answer the
  end for which they were preached and are published, the promotion of
  practical piety."&mdash;<i>John Bull.</i></p>

  <p>".... The sermons are manly and earnest in their resolution to look
  the truth in the face, and to enforce it against a prejudiced resistance
  of which the writer evidently knows but too much; and they show,
  moreover, a true conception of the tone by which that resistance is to be
  met."&mdash;<i>Scottish Episcopal Journal.</i></p>

  Second Edition. 12mo., cloth, 8<i>s.</i></p>

  <p>A SECOND SERIES OF SERMONS. By the REV. ALFRED GATTY. 12mo.,
  8<i>s.</i>, cloth.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"We say willingly of these Sermons, what we can seldom say of sermons
  published at the request of parishioners, that they justify the respect
  paid to them, and appear to us in somewhat the same light as we should
  suppose they seemed to those who listened to and admired them. They are
  sermons of a high and solid character, and are the production of a good
  Churchman. They are earnest and affectionate, and follow out the Church's
  doctrine."&mdash;<i>Theologian.</i></p>

  <p>"Plain and practical, but close and scholarly
  discourses."&mdash;<i>Spectator.</i></p>

  <p>"Warm-hearted and thoughtful."&mdash;<i>Guardian.</i></p>

  Frontispiece, 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"As much a true effigy, though taken with pen and ink, as if Mr. Gatty
  had put that capital parish priest, the Vicar of Leeds, before his
  camera. To the many friends of Dr. Hook this little volume will be deeply
  interesting."&mdash;<i>Notes and Queries.</i></p>

<h3>ELIMINATE.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. v., p. 317.)</p>

  <p>"N. &amp; Q." has from time to time done much good service by holding
  up to reprobation modern and growing corruptions of the English language.
  I trust that its columns may be open to one more attempt to rescue from
  abuse the word which stands at the head of this article.</p>

  <p>Its signification, whether sought from Latin usage and etymology, or
  from the works of English mathematicians, is "to turn out of doors," "to
  oust," or, as we say in the midland counties, "to get shut of." In French
  it may be rendered as well by <i>se défaire</i> as by <i>éliminer</i>.
  Within the last seven or eight years, however, this valuable spoil of
  dead Latinity has been strangely perverted, and, through the ignorance or
  carelessness of writers, it has bidden fair to take to itself two
  significations utterly distinct from its derivation, viz. to "elicit,"
  and to "evaluate." The former signification, if less vicious, is more
  commonly used than the latter. I append examples of both from three of
  the most elegant writers of the day. In the third extract the word under
  consideration is used in the latter sense; in the other extracts it
  carries the former.</p>

  <p><i>Lectures on the Philosophical Tendencies of the Age</i>, by J. D.
  Morrell, London, 1848, p. 41.:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Had the men of ancient times, when they peopled the universe with
  deities, a deeper perception of the religious element in the mind, than
  had Newton, when having <i>eliminated</i> the great law of the natural
  creation, his enraptured soul burst forth into the infinite and
  adored?"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I take one more illustration (among many others) from pp. 145, 146. of
  this work:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"It would not be strictly speaking correct to call them philosophical
  methods, because a philosophical method only exists when any tendency
  works itself clear, and gives rise to a formal, connected, and logical
  system of rules, by which we are to proceed in the <i>elimination</i> of
  truth."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p><i>The Eclipse of Faith</i>, by Professor Rogers, London, 1852, p.
  392.:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"They are now at college, and have imbibed in different degrees that
  curious theory which professedly recognises Christianity (as consigned to
  the New Testament) as a truly <i>divine</i> revelation, yet asserts that
  it is intermingled with a large amount of error and absurdity, and tells
  each man to <i>eliminate</i> the divine 'element' for himself. According
  to this theory, the problem of eliciting revealed truth may be said to be
  indeterminate, the value of the unknown varies through all degrees of
  magnitude; it is equal to any thing, equal to every thing, equal to
  nothing, equal to infinity."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p><i>Theological Essays</i>, by F. D. Maurice, Cambridge, 1853, p.
  89.:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Let us look, therefore, courageously at the popular dogma, that there
  are certain great ideas floating in the vast ocean of traditions which
  the old world exhibits to us, that the gospel appropriated some of these,
  and that we are to detect them and <i>eliminate</i> them from its own
  traditions."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>But for the fact that such writers have given the weight of their
  names to so unparalleled a blunder, it would seem almost childish to
  occupy the columns of a literary periodical with exposing it. It is,
  however, somewhat singular that it should be principally men of
  <i>classical</i> attainments who perpetrate it. In my under-graduate days
  at Cambridge, the proneness of "classical men" to commit the blunder in
  question was proverbial.</p>

  <p>In conclusion, then, let it be remembered that the word "eliminate"
  obtained general currency from the circumstance of its being originally
  admitted into mathematical works. In such works <i>elimination</i>
  signifies the process of causing a function to disappear from an
  equation, the solution of which would be embarrassed by its presence
  there. In other writings the word "elimination" has but one correct
  signification, viz. "the extrusion of that which is superfluous or
  irrelevant." As an example of this legitimate use of the word, I will
  quote from Sir William Hamilton's accurate, witty, and learned article on
  "Logic," published in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>, April, 1833:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The preparatory step of the discussion was, therefore, an
  <i>elimination</i> of these less precise and appropriate significations,
  which, as they could at best only afford a remote genus and difference,
  were wholly incompetent for the purpose of a definition."</p>

<h3>CRANMER'S BIBLE.</h3>

  <p>Queries which I have heard at various times lead me to think that a
  Note on this interesting volume may be acceptable to many readers who
  possess or have access to it; and especially to those whose copies may be
  (as too many are) imperfect at the beginning and end. Under this
  impression I send you an extract from the late Mr. Lea Wilson's catalogue
  of his unrivalled Collection of English Bibles. As very few copies of
  this curious and beautiful work were printed, and not one, I believe, has
  been sold, it is probable that few of your readers are aware of the
  criteria which that gentleman's ingenuity and industry have furnished for
  distinguishing between the <!-- Page 120 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page120"></a>{120}</span>various editions which are known under the
  title of <i>The Great Bible</i>, or <i>Cranmer's Bible</i>. He begins his
  description of the edition of April, 1539, thus:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"As this volume is commonly called the First Edition of Cranmer's or
  the Great Bible, I class it with the Six following; although in fact the
  Archbishop had nothing whatever to do with either the translation or
  publication. It was put forth entirely by Thomas Lord Cromwell, vide
  Herbert's <i>Ames</i>, p. 1550. vol. iii., who employed Coverdale to
  revise the existing translations. The first wherein Cranmer took any part
  is the large folio of April 1540, the text of which differs from this
  edition materially. The pages of this volume and of the four next
  following begin and end alike; and the general appearance of the whole
  five is so very similar that at first sight, one may be mistaken for
  another by those ignorant of the fact that they are all separate and
  distinct impressions: the whole of the titles, of which there are five in
  each Book, and every leaf of kalendar, prologue, text, and tables being
  entirely recomposed, and varying throughout in orthography, &amp;c. The
  desire to make perfect copies out of several imperfect, has also caused
  extreme confusion, by uniting portions of different editions without due
  regard to their identity. These remarks apply equally to the editions of
  Nov. 1540, and Nov. 1541, of which, in like manner, each page begins and
  ends with the same words. Although the distinctive marks are very
  numerous, yet being chiefly typographical ornaments or arrangement, it is
  impossible to give here sufficient guides to ensure the integrity of each
  volume."&mdash;Page 12.</p>

  <p>On the next page but one is added:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  distinguishing the edition I have given them to each."</p>

  <p>I believe the foregoing to be an exact copy of Mr. Wilson's catalogue,

  would have done it with more care and fidelity than himself.</p>

<h3>SOVEREIGNS DINING AND SUPPING IN PUBLIC.</h3>

  <p>In some observations which I made upon two or three pictures in
  Hampton Court Palace, in Vol. viii., p. 538., I specified two worthy of
  notice on the above subject, and which are the first instances of such
  ceremony I have met with. It has been supposed to have been a foreign
  custom but I do not find any traces of it upon record.<a
  name="footnotetag1" href="#footnote1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> <!-- Page 121
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page121"></a>{121}</span>One can easily
  imagine that the <i>fastueux</i> Louis XIV. would have no objection to
  such display, and that his mistresses, as well as queen, would be of the
  party, when we read, that in the royal progresses two of the former were
  scandalously paraded in the same carriage with his queen. To this immoral
  exhibition, indeed, public opinion seemed to give no check, as we read,
  that "les peuples accouraient 'pour voir,' disaient-ils, 'les trois
  reines,'" wherever they appeared together. Of these three <i>queens</i>,
  the true one was Marie-Thérèse: the two others were La Marquise de
  Montespan and Mme. de la Vallière. But to return to my subject. I find by
  the <i>London Gazette</i>, No. 6091. of Sept. 4, 1722, that Geo. I., in
  his progress to the west of England, supped in public at the Bishop's
  (Dr. Richard Willis) palace at Salisbury on Wednesday, Aug. 29, 1722; and
  slept there that night.</p>

  <p>The papers of the period of George II. say:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"There was such a resort to Hampton Court on Sunday, July 14, 1728, to
  see their Majesties dine, that the rail surrounding the table broke; and
  causing some to fall, made a terrible scramble for hats, &amp;c., at
  which their Majesties laughed heartily."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>And,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"On Thursday, the 25th of the same month, it is stated, the concourse
  to see their Majesties dine in public at Hampton Court was exceedingly
  great. A gang of robbers (the swell-mob of that day?) had mixed
  themselves among the nobility and gentry; several gold watches being
  lost, besides the ladies' gown tails and laced lappets cut off in
  number."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>And again:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"On Sunday, 15th September, 1728, their Majesties dined together in
  public at Windsor (as they will continue to do every Sunday and Thursday
  during their stay there), when all the country people, whether in or out
  of mourning, were permitted to see them."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Besides those three occasions of George II. and Queen Caroline dining
  in public, we have another recorded attended with some peculiar
  circumstances, as mentioned in the <i>London Gazette</i>, No. 7623. of
  Tuesday, Aug. 2, 1737:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The 31st ult. being Sunday, their Majesties, the Prince and Princess
  of Wales, and the Princesses Amelia and Caroline, went to chapel at
  Hampton Court, and heard a sermon preached by the Rev. Dr. Blomer. Their
  Majesties, and the rest of the royal family, dined afterwards in public
  as usual before a great number of spectators. About seven o'clock that
  evening, the Princess of Wales was taken with some slight symptoms of
  approaching labour, and was removed to St. James's; where, a little after
  eleven, she was delivered of a princess."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This was the Princess Augusta, who was married to the Prince of
  Brunswick Wolfenbüttel.</p>

<div class="note">
  <a name="footnote1"></a><b>Footnote 1:</b><a
  href="#footnotetag1">(return)</a>
  <p>[The custom was observed at a much earlier period; for we find that
  King Edward II. and his queen Isabella of France kept their court at
  Westminster during the Whitsuntide festival of 1317; and on one occasion,
  as they were <i>dining in public</i> in the great banqueting-hall, a
  woman in a mask entered on horseback, and riding up to the royal table,
  delivered a letter to King Edward, who, imagining that it contained some
  pleasant conceit or elegant compliment; ordered it to be opened and read
  aloud for the amusement of his courtiers; but, to his great
  mortification, it was a cutting satire on his unkingly propensities,
  setting forth in no measured terms all the calamities which his
  misgovernment had brought upon England. The woman was immediately taken
  into custody, and confessed that she had been employed by a certain
  knight. The knight boldly acknowledged what he had done, and said, "That,
  supposing the King would read the letter in private, he took that method
  of apprising him of the complaints of his subjects."&mdash;Strickland's

<h3>THE GREAT ALPHABETIC PSALM, AND THE SONGS OF DEGREES.</h3>

  <p>In attempting to discover a reason for the division of Psalm cxix.
  into twenty-two portions of <i>eight</i> verses each, instead of
  <i>seven</i> or <i>ten</i>, the more favourite numbers of the Hebrew, I
  have thought that, as the whole Psalm is chiefly laudatory of the Thorah,
  or Law of Moses, and was written alphabetically for the instruction
  mainly of the younger people, to be by them committed to memory, a <!--
  Page 122 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page122"></a>{122}</span>didactic reason might exist for making up
  the total number of 176 verses, peculiar to this Psalm. Adverting then to
  the necessity, for the purposes of Jewish worship, of ascertaining the
  periods of the new moons, to adjust the year thereby, I find that a mean
  lunation, as determined by the latest authorities, is very nearly 29.5306
  days (29d. 12h. 44m.) and as the Jewish months were lunar, six of these
  would amount to 177d. 4h. 24m., being somewhat more than <i>one</i> over
  the number of verses in this Psalm. As lunations, from observation, vary
  from 29d. 7h. 32m. to 29d. 18h. 50m., the above was a very close
  approximation to the half-year. The other half of the year would vary a
  whole lunation (<i>Veadar</i>) betwixt the ordinary and the intercalary
  year.<a name="footnotetag2" href="#footnote2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> This
  was, at least, the best possible combination of twenty-two letters for
  such purpose. This Psalm might then have answered some of the purposes of
  an almanac. It is a very important one in fixing the Hebrew metres, the
  initial letter being the same for every eight verses in succession.</p>

  <p>The words at the commencement of Psalms cxx. to cxxxiv., rendered
  "Song of Degrees," appear to me to signify rather "song of
  <i>ascents</i>," in reference to the Jewish practice of <i>ascending</i>
  to the house-top to watch and pray, as well as to sleep. If it be assumed
  that these fifteen Psalms were appropriated for domestic use on the Jew
  retiring, by ascending the ladder or stairs, to the upper part or top of
  the house (Ps. cxxxii. 3.), the meaning of several passages will be
  better apprehended, I conceive, than by supposing that they were composed
  solely for temple use, or, as Eichhorn thinks, to be sung on a journey.
  Standing on the house-top, the praying Jew, like David and Solomon, would
  have in view heaven and earth (cxxi. 2., cxxiii 1.), the sun and moon
  (cxxi. 6.), the surrounding hills (cxxi. 1.) and mountains (cxxv. 2.),
  the gates and city of Jerusalem (cxxii. 2. 3. 7.), Mount Zion (cxxv. 1.),
  the watchmen on the walls (cxxvii. 1., cxxx. 6.), his wife and children
  at home (cxxviii. 3., cxxxi. 2.), the mover bringing in his sheaves,
  compared with the grass on the house-tops (cxxix. 6-8.), all subjects
  especially noted in these fifteen Psalms. The number <i>eight</i> appears
  to be a favourite one in these, as well as in Psalm cxix., but there is
  no reason to believe that such number refers to the <i>octave</i> in
  music. It may refer, however, to the number of stairs or steps of ascent.
  I am not aware that the above views have been previously taken, which is
  my reason for calling attention to this interesting and well-debated
  subject.</p>

<h2>Queries.</h2>

<h3>CORONATION STONE.</h3>

  <p>A few years ago the following tradition was related to me by a friend,
  and I should be glad if any of your correspondents can inform me whether
  it is current in any part of Great Britain or Ireland, and whether there
  are any grounds for it. As it is connected with one of our most
  interesting national relics, the coronation stone, it may not prove
  beneath notice; and I here give it in full, shielding myself with the
  Last Minstrel's excuse:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"I know not how the truth may be,</p>
      <p>But I tell the tale as 'twas told to me."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>I must allow that its extreme vagueness, if not improbability, hardly
  warrants an inquiry; but having failed in obtaining any satisfactory
  proofs among my own friends, as a last resource I apply myself to the
  columns of your well-known and useful journal.</p>

  <p>When Jacob awoke after his wonderful dream, as related in Genesis
  (chap. xxviii.), he said, "Surely the Lord is in this place, and I knew
  it not;" and he was afraid, and said, "How dreadful is this place. This
  is none other but the house of God; and this is the gate of heaven." He
  "took the stone that he had put for his pillow and set it up for a
  pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it. And Jacob vowed a vow, saying,
  If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will
  give me bread to eat and raiment to put on, so that I come again to my
  father's house in peace, then shall the Lord be my God: and this stone,
  which I have set for a pillar, shall be God's house; and of all that Thou
  shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto Thee."</p>

  <p>That stone (so runs the legend) is supposed to have been taken away
  from Bethel by the House of Joseph, when they destroyed the city and its
  inhabitants (Judges i.); and a tradition, that whosoever possessed that
  stone would be especially blessed, and be king or chief, was current
  among the Jews; the stone itself being guarded by them with jealous
  care.</p>

  <p>On the first destruction of Jerusalem, some of the royal family of
  Judah are supposed to have escaped, and to have gone in search of an
  asylum beyond the sea, taking this precious stone with them. Their
  resting-place was Ireland, where they founded a kingdom. Many centuries
  afterwards, a brother of the king descended from these exiles, named
  Fergus, went, with his brother's permission, to found a kingdom in
  Scotland. He said, however, he would not go without the sacred stone.
  This his brother refused to give him; but Fergus stole it, and
  established a kingdom in Scotland. His descendants became kings of all
  Scotland, and were crowned sitting on that stone, <!-- Page 124 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page124"></a>{124}</span>which was taken away by
  Edward I., and is now in Westminster Abbey.</p>

  <p>These are the outlines of this tradition. My object now is to ask
  whether any of your correspondents can inform me, first, Whether the Jews
  had, or have, any like superstition concerning Jacob's pillar; and
  whether the royal family of Judah possessed such a stone among their
  treasures? Secondly, Whether any Jews are supposed to have settled in
  Ireland at so early a period; and whether (that being the case) there are
  now, or were once, proofs of their having done so, either in the Irish
  language or in any of the ancient laws, customs, buildings, &amp;c. of
  the country? Thirdly, Whether the Scotch believe that stone to have come
  from Ireland; and whether that belief in the owner of it being king
  existed in Scotland? and, lastly, Can any of your correspondents, learned
  in geology, inform me whether the like kind of stone is to be met with in
  any part of the British Isles? or whether, as the legend runs, a similar
  kind of stone is found in the Arabian plains? The story has interested me
  greatly; and if I could gain any enlightenment on the subject, I should
  be much obliged for it.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">An Indian Subscriber.</span></p>

<div class="note">
  <p>[Several of our historians, as Matthew of Westminster, Hector
  Boethius, Robert of Gloucester, the poet Harding, &amp;c., have noticed
  this singular legend; but we believe the Rabbinical writers (as suggested
  by our Indian correspondent) have never been consulted respecting it.
  Sandford, in his valuable <i>History of the Coronation of James II</i>.
  (fol., 1687, p. 39.), has given some dates and names which will probably
  assist our correspondents in elucidating the origin of this far-famed
  relic. He says, "Jacob's stone, or <i>The Fatal Marble Stone</i>, is an
  oblong square, about twenty-two inches long, thirteen inches broad, and
  eleven inches deep, of a bluish steel-like colour, mixed with some veins
  of red; whereof history relates that it is the stone whereon the
  patriarch Jacob is said to have lain his head in the plain of Luza. That
  it was brought to Brigantia in the kingdom of Gallacia in Spain, in which
  place Gathal, King of Scots, sat on it as his throne. Thence it was
  brought into Ireland by Simon Brech, first King of Scots, about 700 years
  before Christ's time, and from thence into Scotland, by King Fergus,
  about 330 years before Christ. In the year 850 it was placed in the abbey
  of Scone in the sherifdom of Perth by King Kenneth, who caused it to be
  inclosed in a wooden chair (now called St. Edward's Chair), and this
  prophetical distich engraven on it:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Ni fallat Fatum, Scoti hunc quocunque locatum</p>
      <p>Inveniunt lapidem, regnare tenentur ibidem.'</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'If Fates go right, where'er this stone is found,</p>
      <p>The Scots shall monarchs of that realm be crown'd.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Which is the more remarkable by being fulfilled in the person of James
  I. of England." Calmet, however, states that the Mahometans profess to
  have this relic in their custody. He says, The Mahometans think that
  Jacob's stone was conveyed to the Temple of Jerusalem, and is still
  preserved in the mosque there, where the Temple formerly stood. They call
  it <i>Al-sakra</i>, or the stone of unction. The Cadi Gemaleddin, son of
  Vallel, writes, that passing through Jerusalem, in his way to Egypt, he
  saw Christian priests carrying glass phials full of wine over the Sakra,
  near which the Mussulmen had built their temple, which, for this reason,
  they call the Temple of the Stone. The wine which the Christian priests
  set upon the stone was no doubt designed for the celebration of mass
  there."]</p>

<h3>OLD MEREWORTH CASTLE, KENT.</h3>

  <p>Among your subscribers there are doubtless many collectors of
  topographical drawings and engravings. I shall feel specially obliged if
  any of them could find in their collections a view of old Mereworth
  Castle (as it stood prior to the comparatively modern erection of Lord
  Westmoreland), and furnish me with a long desiderated description of it.
  Local tradition represents it as having been a baronial castle rising
  from the middle of a small lake, like that of Leeds, though of smaller
  dimensions, with the parish church attached. I should rather conjecture
  it to have been an ancient moated manor-house, magnified, in the course
  of tradition, into a baronial castle and lake.</p>

  <p>Whatever the old building was, it was pulled down by John, seventh
  Earl of Westmoreland, during the first half of the last century. Had it
  been of the character of Leeds Castle, as the representative of a long
  line of baronial ancestry, he would hardly have levelled such a
  structure, with all its inspiring associations, merely for the purpose of
  gratifying his passion for Palladian architecture by the erection of the
  present mansion.</p>

  <p>The ancient building seems to have been the residence of the knightly
  family of De Mereworth during the twelfth, thirteenth, and part of the
  fourteenth centuries, and from that time, till near the end of
  Elizabeth's reign, it ceased to be a <i>family residence</i>; for, after
  passing through various hands (none of whom were likely to have resided
  there), it descended in 1415 to Joan, wife of the Lord Burgavenny, sister
  and coheir to the Earl of Arundel. The Burgavennys of that day resided
  always at their castle of Birling, which circumstance would intimate that
  it was a grander and more baronial residence than Mereworth Castle (for
  they had come into possession of both estates very nearly at the same
  period); and afterwards Mereworth by settlement passed to Sir Thomas Fane
  of Badsell, in marriage with Mary, daughter and sole heiress of Henry
  Lord Burgavenny, and "jure suo" Baroness Despencer, in 1574. From that
  time till its dismantling in the last century, Mereworth Castle was again
  a family residence, the seat of the Earls of Westmoreland; Francis,
  eldest son of said Sir Thomas <!-- Page 125 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page125"></a>{125}</span>Fane and Mary Baroness Despencer, having
  been advanced to that earldom. As the seat of a noble family for more
  than a century and a half, it is hardly likely that no view should have
  been taken of it; I have searched, however, in vain for it in Harris,
  Buck, and other published collections.</p>

  <p>It would be a matter of special interest to many besides myself, to
  obtain some information respecting it.</p>

  <p>John, seventh earl, the builder of the present Palladian mansion, died
  in 1762, when the earldom passed to a distant cousin, and the barony of
  Despencer was called out of abeyance in favour of Sir Francis Dashwood,
  the son and representative of Mary, sister and <i>eldest</i> co-heir of
  John, seventh Earl of Westmoreland, and heir to his estates. On his death
  <i>s.p.</i>, Sir Thomas Stapleton, sole heir to the Barony of Despencer
  (as lineal descendant and heir of Catherine, the <i>younger</i> sister
  and co-heir of the said John, seventh earl), succeeded to the estate; and
  from him it has lineally descended to Mary, Viscountess Falmouth, and
  "jure suo" Baroness Despencer, the present representative of the family.
  At Mereworth Castle itself, where the Viscount and Viscountess Falmouth
  reside, there is no view of the old building; but it is very possible
  that some drawing or engraving of it may exist in some of the residences
  of the Earls of Westmoreland subsequent to the seventh earl, or at the
  seat of the Dashwoods, or in the British Museum.</p>

  <p><i>O'Brien of Thosmond.</i>&mdash;In the <i>Calendar of Inquisitions

  Nicholas Thosmound, in the second year of King Henry IV. The estates were
  in Somersetshire. From the appearance of this name, I suspect it is not
  an English one; but rather an old form of spelling the name of the
  province of Tothmound or Thomond (South Munster), Ireland; and that this
  Nicholas was an O'Brien, who called himself from his family's
  principality, for it was not uncommon in England formerly to take names
  from estates. Perhaps some of your correspondents having access to the
  <i>Inquisition</i> would ascertain more on the subject, and give it to
  the public. The name of Nicholas O'Brien occurs in the Irish rolls of

  <p><i>Order of St. David of Wales.</i>&mdash;In the reign of Queen

  hope the good Queen Victoria will revive this ancient order of
  knighthood, and the Prince of Wales be created the first knight. The
  emblem of Wales is a red dragon.</p>

  <p>Can any of your readers give an account of this ancient order? Some

  <p>The spelling of this extract seems at least as old as the time of
  Cloudesley's death (1517), although it would appear to be a translation;
  and though the exorcism is apparently spoken of as having taken place
  long before the time of the writer. From these and other circumstances, I
  am led to suspect that Nelson was the victim of cruel hoax, particularly
  as I am unable to find any such book as <i>Purlet de Mir. Nat.</i> in the
  British Museum.</p>

  <p><i>Liveries, Red and Scarlet.</i>&mdash;In a Provincial paper, I

  from a mandate of Henry II., who it appears made fox-hunting a royal
  sport, and gave to all distributors of foxes the scarlet uniform of the
  royal household: this also would involve another question as regards the
  origin of scarlet being the colour of the royal livery. Can any of your

  worthy of notice, that while the omission of the dog is frequent in the
  brasses of ladies (e.g. in that of Lady Camoys, 1424, at Trotten, Sussex,
  and Joan, Lady Cobham, 1320, Cobham, Kent, and several others), the lion
  or dog, as the case may be, of the knight is scarcely ever left out;
  indeed, I have only been able to find two or three instances. But again,
  in brasses later than 1460, the dogs and lions are seldom, if ever, found
  either in the brasses of knights or ladies. Can you afford me any
  information on these points?</p>

  edition, containing the passages cancelled by the Earl, is that of 1732,
  fol. "This work," says Bishop Warburton, "that has been so much cried up,
  is a meagre diary, wrote by a poor-spirited, self-interested, and
  self-conceited lawyer of eminence, but full of facts." At p. 378. (edit.

  till its conclusion. Is this custom observed in other places? and (if

  historically, as a part of a narrative, which indicates that the whole
  sacred narrative should be treated, as it was anciently, with the like
  reverence. The rubric says nothing about sitting; standing and kneeling
  being the only postures expressly recognised. In the curious engraving of
  the interior of a church, prefixed to Bishop Sparrow's <i>Rationale upon
  the Book of Common Prayer</i>, 1661, there is not a seat of any kind to
  be seen, pews not having become at this time a general appendage to
  churches; probably a few chairs or benches were required for the aged or
  infirm.. The only intimation of the sitting posture in our present Common
  Prayer-Book occurs in the rubric, enjoining the people to stand when the

<h3>"CONSILIUM NOVEM DELECTORUM CARDINALIUM," ETC.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. viii., p. 54.)</p>

  <p>The Note of your correspondent <span class="sc">Novus</span> upon this
  <i>Consilium</i> ought to have been answered before; but as none of your
  contributors who can speak as "having authority" have undertaken to do
  so, I beg to offer to your readers the following statements and extracts,
  collected when my surprise at the assertions of <span
  class="sc">Novus</span> was quite fresh. <!-- Page 128 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page128"></a>{128}</span></p>

  <p>The first point on which <span class="sc">Novus</span> requires
  correction is, the name of the pontiff to whom the <i>Consilium</i>
  purports to be addressed. <span class="sc">Novus</span> says Julius III.,
  but the date of this document is unquestionably not later than the
  beginning of 1538, for Sleidan tells us that editions of it were printed
  at Rome, at Cologne, at Strasburg, and at another place, in the course of
  the year 1538; and in the title it is distinctly stated to have been
  presented to Paul III., who was pope in that year, whilst Julius III. was
  not elected till 1550.</p>

  <p>When <span class="sc">Novus</span> says that this <i>Consilium</i>
  "has just been once more quoted, for the fiftieth time, perhaps, within
  the present generation, as a genuine document, and as proceeding from
  adherents of the Church of Rome," he falls short of the fact. For
  <i>every writer</i> of the least mark, or likelihood, whose subject has
  led him that way, has quoted it: thus, <i>e.g.</i>, Ranke, who in his
  great work on <i>The Popes and the Papacy</i>, book ii. § 2., refers to
  it as indicative of no dishonourable design on the part of the supreme
  pontiff.</p>

  <p>Amongst the writers of the time when the <i>Consilium</i> is said to
  have been drawn up, who regarded it as genuine, we may mention Luther,
  who, soon after it found its way into Germany, published a translation,
  with one of his biting caricatures prefixed; and Sturm, who prefaced his
  translation with a letter to the cardinals to whom it was ascribed, for
  which reason alone his edition was put in the "Index," no other edition
  being similarly honoured; and this sufficiently refutes a statement of
  Schelhorn, in his letter to Cardinal Quirinus, upon which much reliance
  has been placed by those whom <span class="sc">Novus</span> would regard
  as sharers of his opinion.</p>

  <p>The appearance of the editions at Cologne and Strasburg in 1538,
  testifies to the speed with which the <i>Consilium</i> reached Germany.
  Sleidan asserts that, when it was published there, some fancied it to be
  fictitious, and intended to ridicule both the Pope and the Reformation;
  but others, that it was a device of the Pope to gain credit for not being
  hostile to the correction of certain confessed abuses. In the next year,
  on July 16th, Aleander wrote to Cochlæus thus:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Multa haberem scribere de Republica, sed mali custodes estis rerum
  arcanarum,&mdash;Consiliis Cardinalium promulgatis, cum invectiva
  Sturmii, manibus hominum teritur, antequam vel auctoribus edita, vel
  executioni fuerit demandata."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Which passage might be regarded as decisive of the question of
  genuineness, since Aleander was one of the <i>Cardinales delecti</i>
  whose names are appended to the <i>Consilium</i>.</p>

  <p>That Le Plat should insert a copy in his <i>Monument. ad Hist. Concil.
  Trident. potius illustr. spect.</i>, may, perhaps, be considered an
  unsatisfactory argument; and the same will certainly be thought of the
  use of it by Sarpi. But Pallavicini is a witness not obnoxious to
  objections which apply to them, and he says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"It happened by Divine Providence, that this <i>Consilium</i> was
  published, since it showed what were in fact the deepest wounds in the
  discipline of the Church, ascertained with great diligence, and exposed
  with the utmost freedom by men of incomparable zeal and knowledge. And
  these were neither falsity of dogmas, nor corruption of the Scriptures,
  nor wickedness of laws, nor politic craft beneath the garb of humility,
  nor impure vices, as the Lutherans asserted; but too great indulgence
  towards violations and abrogations of laws, which Luther far more
  licentiously abrogated," &amp;c.&mdash;Vide book <span
  class="sm">IV</span>. ch. v., at the end.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>But Ranke's note upon a casual reference to this document in book
  <span class="sm">I</span>. ch. ii. § 2. of his <i>History of the
  Papacy</i>, completely disposes of the question of its genuineness, and
  therefore of its "seriousness" (to use one of <span
  class="sc">Novus'</span> phrases), when taken in conjunction with what
  has gone before.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<i>Consilium, &amp;c.</i>; printed more than once even at the time,
  and important as pointing out the evil, so far as it lay in the
  administration of discipline, precisely and without reserve. Long after
  it had been printed, <i>the MS. remained incorporated with the MSS. of
  the Curia</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Were it not that the assertion of <span class="sc">Novus</span> is so
  roundly made, and in a form that is sure to adhere in the memories of
  readers sufficiently interested in the subject to notice his
  communication, it would have been enough to quote from one of the works
  he refers to, as containing copies of the <i>Consilium</i>, to expose
  <i>the origin of his error</i>; and this, now that I have shown it to be
  an error, I crave your permission to do. This, then, is what Brown says
  in his <i>Appendix ad Fascicul. Rer. Expetend. et Fugiend.</i> (commonly
  cited as <i>Fascicul. vol. ii.</i>), ed. 1690, pp. 230, 231.:</p>

<h3>JOHN BUNYAN.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. ix., p. 104.)</p>

  <p>A highly respected correspondent, <span class="sc">Dr. S. R.
  Maitland</span>, has seen an advertisement in the <i>Mercurius
  Reformatus</i> of June 11, 1690, announcing the intention of Bunyan's
  widow to publish ten manuscripts which her husband had left prepared for
  the press, together with some of his printed treatises which had become
  scarce. He inquires whether such a publication took place. In reply I beg
  leave to state that they were published in a small folio, containing "ten
  [and two fragments] of his excellent manuscripts, and ten of his choice
  books formerly printed." The volume bears the title of "The Works of that
  eminent Servant of Christ Mr. John Bunyan, late Minister of the Gospel
  and Pastor of the Congregation at Bedford. The first volume. London, by
  Wm. Marshall, 1692." It has the portrait by Sturt, and an impression from
  the original curious copper-plate inscribed, "A Mapp, showing the order
  and causes of Salvation and Damnation." In addition to the
  <i>Mercurius</i>, John Dunton and others noticed, in terms of warm
  approval, the intended publication, which became extensively patronised,
  but has now become very scarce.</p>

  <p>To the lovers of Bunyan it is peculiarly interesting, being
  accompanied by a tract called "The Struggler," written by one of his
  affectionate and intimate friends, the Rev. C. Doe, containing a list of
  Bunyan's works, with the time when each of them was published, some
  personal characteristic anecdotes, and thirty reasons why all decided
  Christians should read and circulate these invaluable treatises. A copy
  presented to me by my worthy friend the late Mr. Creasy of Sleaford,
  which is in remarkably fine condition, has on the title to the Index a
  printed dedication to Sir John Hartop of Newington, the patron and friend
  of Dr. Watts. This volume was to have been followed by a second, to
  complete Bunyan's works, but difficulties arose as to the copyright of
  the more popular pieces, which prevented its publication. The original
  prospectus is preserved in the British Museum, which, with "The
  Struggler" and a new index to the whole of these truly excellent
  treatises, is reprinted in my edition of Bunyan's whole works for the
  first time collected and published, with his Life, in three volumes
  imperial 8vo., illustrated with fac-similes of all the old woodcuts and
  many elegant steel plates.</p>

<h3>THE ASTEROIDS, ETC.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. ix., p. 36.)</p>

  <p>It is certainly an uncomfortable idea to suppose that the asteroids
  are the fragments of a former world, perhaps accompanied with satellites
  which have been scattered either by internal convulsion or external
  violence. By looking into the constitution and powers contained within
  our own earth, we know that the means are not wanting to rend us asunder
  under the combined effects of volcanic action, intense heat, and water,
  meeting deep within the substance of the earth under great pressure.</p>

  <p>However, there is much to be said against the theory of Olbers,
  notwithstanding its plausibility. The distance between the internal
  asteroid Flora, and the external one Hygeia, exceeds ninety millions of
  miles; or nearly the distance between the earth and the sun. The force
  which could shatter a world into fragments, and drive them asunder to
  such an extent, must indeed be tremendous.</p>

  <p>Mr. Hind has drawn attention to the singular fact, that the asteroids
  "appear to separate the planets of small mass from the greater bodies of
  the system, the planets which rotate on their axes in about the same time
  as our earth from those which are whirled round in less than half that
  time, though of ten times the diameter of the earth and," he continues,
  "it may yet be found that these small bodies, so far from being portions
  <!-- Page 130 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page130"></a>{130}</span>of the wreck of a planet, were created in
  their present state for some wise purpose, which the progress of
  astronomy in future ages may eventually unfold."</p>

  <p>One thing I think is certain, that no disruption of a world belonging
  to our system could take place without producing some perceptible effect
  upon every other member of the system. The single centre of attraction
  being suddenly diffused and spread abroad into many smaller ones, at
  variable distances, must produce a sudden sway and alteration of position
  in all the other planets, and to a certain extent, derange their
  respective economies. From this some striking changes would necessarily
  arise, such as in the length of their respective periods of revolution,
  the amount of light and heat, and other physical conditions. Certain
  geological phenomena should be found to confirm such a change, if these
  suppositions be true.</p>

  <p>As far as the theological part of the question is concerned, it is, I
  should think, opposed to Olbers' theory. Human intellect can scarcely
  conceive the necessity for the utter breaking up of a globe, even for the
  most grievous amount of sin. A more merciful dispensation was granted to
  our earth in the deluge; and the Power which removed all but eight lives
  from the earth could have equally removed the eight also, without
  destroying the integrity of the globe. It is as easy, and far more
  reasonable I think, to suppose, that the same Power which gave to Saturn
  a satellite nearly equal in size to Mars, should throw a cluster of
  minute planetoids into the space which, according to Bodes' empirical
  law, should have been devoted to one planet of larger dimensions.</p>

  <p>Whilst addressing you on astronomical subjects, I would beg leave to
  offer a few remarks upon Saturn, which I have not observed in any work on
  astronomy which I have yet consulted. This planet, with its satellites,
  appear to exhibit a close resemblance to the solar system, just as if it
  were a model of it.</p>

  <p>Besides his rings, Saturn is attended by eight satellites, so far as
  is at present known. The names of the satellites in their order from the
  body of the planet, are 1. Mimas, 2. Euceladus, 3. Tethys, 4. Dione, 5.
  Rhea, 6. Titan, 7. Hyperion, 8. Japetus. If we place them in a list in
  their order, and overagainst each place the names of the planets in their
  order from the sun, certain parallelisms will appear:</p>

<table class="mc">
<tr><td> 1. Mimas</td>
<td> 1. Mercury.</td></tr>
<tr><td> 2. Euceladus<span class="gap" style="width:4em;"></span></td>
<td> 2. Venus.</td></tr>
<tr><td> 3. Tethys</td>
<td> 3. Earth.</td></tr>
<tr><td> 4. Dione</td>
<td> 4. Mars.</td></tr>
<tr><td> 5. Rhea</td>
<td> 5. Asteroids.</td></tr>
<tr><td> 6. Titan</td>
<td> 6. Jupiter.</td></tr>
<tr><td> 7. Hyperion</td>
<td> 7. Saturn.</td></tr>
<tr><td> 8. Japetus</td>
<td> 8. Uranus.</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>The relative magnitudes and relative positions of these bodies
  correspond in many points, I believe, so far as is at present known.
  Titan, like Jupiter, is the largest of his system; being but little less
  in size than the primary planet Mars. The next in magnitude is Japetus.
  Rhea is supposed to be of considerable size. The four inner ones are
  smaller than the others. Sir William Herschell considered that Tethys was
  larger than Euceladus, and Euceladus larger than Mimas. Dione and
  Hyperion have not yet been well estimated. These dimensions, if correct,
  correspond in many points with those of the planets. The first three
  satellites revolve in orbits of less diameter than that of our moon. The
  orbit of Dione, the fourth satellite, is almost precisely at the same
  distance from its primary as the moon is from the earth. As if to carry
  out the parallelism to the utmost, the zodiacal light of the sun has
  often been compared to the ring of Saturn.</p>

  <p>One remark it would appear arises out of these observations, viz. that
  the laws of attraction and gravitation seem to require, for the proper
  regulation of the whole system, that where a number of bodies of various
  sizes revolve round one common centre, the larger body should revolve at
  a certain relative distance from that centre. Thus Titan, like a huge
  pendulum, seems to sway and maintain the regularity of the minor system,
  just as Jupiter may be imagined to do in the great one.</p>

  <p>I must not intrude too far on your valuable space, but there remain
  some interesting points for discussion in the Saturnian system.</p>

<h3>CAPS AT CAMBRIDGE.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. ix., p. 27.)</p>

  <p>The extract from an unpublished MS. given by <span class="sc">A Regent
  M.A. of Cambridge</span> refers to the year 1620, as will appear from the
  following passages in Anthony à Wood's <i>Hist. and Antiq. of Univ. of
  Oxford</i>.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"1614.&mdash;In the latter end of the last and beginning of this year,
  a spirit of sedition (as I may so call it) possessed certain of the
  Regent Masters against the Vicechanc. and Doctors. The chief and only
  matter that excited them to it was their sitting like boys, bare-headed,
  in the Convocation-House, at the usual assemblies there, which was not,
  as 'twas thought, so fit, that the Professors of the Faculty of Arts (on
  which the University was founded) should, all things considered, do it.
  The most forward person among them, named Henry Wightwicke, of Gloucester
  Hall, having had some intimation of a statute which enabled them to be
  covered with their caps, and discovering also something in the large west
  window of St. Mary's Church, where pictures of Regents and non-Regents
  were sitting covered in assemblies before the Chancellor, clapt <!-- Page
  131 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page131"></a>{131}</span>on his
  cap, and spared not to excite his brethren to vindicate that custom, now
  in a manner forgotten; and, having got over one of the Regents to be more
  zealous in the matter than himself, procured the hands of most, if not
  all, of them to be set to a petition (in order to be sent to the
  Chancellor of the University), for the effecting and bringing about the
  matter. But the Vicechancellor, Dr. Singleton, having had timely notice
  of the design, sends a full relation of the matter to the Chancellor;
  whereupon answer was returned, that he should deal therein as he should
  think fit. Wightwicke, therefore, being called into question for
  endeavouring to subvert the honour and government of the University,
  whereby he ran himself into perjury (he having before taken an oath to
  keep and maintain the rites, customs, and privileges of the University),
  was banished, and his party, who had proved false to him, severely checkt
  by the Chancellor.</p>

  <p>"At length Wightwicke's friends, laying open to him the danger that he
  would run himself into, if he should not seek restauration and submit,
  did, after his peevish and rash humour had been much courted to it, put
  up a petition (subscribed in his behalf by the Bishop of London and Sir
  John Bennett) to the Chancellor of the University for his restauration,
  which being with much ado granted, but with this condition, that he make
  an humble recantation in the Convocation, sent to his Vicechancellor what
  should be done in the matter, and among other things thus:&mdash;'For the
  manner of his submission and recognition which he is to make, I will not
  take upon me to direct, but leave yt wholy unto your wisdomes, as well
  for manner as for the matter; only thus much generally I will intimate
  unto you, that the affront and offence committed by Whittwicke in the
  Congregation House by his late insolent carriage there was very great and
  notorious, and that offence afterwards seconded and redoubled by another
  as ill or worse than the former, in his seditious practizing and
  procuring a multitude of handes, thereby thinking to justifie and
  maintain his former errors, and his proud and insolent disobedience and
  contempt. I hold yt therefore very requisite that his submission and
  recognition, both of the one fault and of the other, should be as
  publique and as humble as possibly with conveniencye may bee. Which being
  thus openly done, as I hope yt will bee a good example to others, to
  deter them from committing the like offence hereafter, so I do also wishe
  this his punishment may be only <i>ad correctionem et non ad
  destructionem</i>."</p>

  <p>"This being the effect of the Chancellor's mind, Wightwicke was
  summoned to appear to make his submission in the next Convocation, which
  being held 25 June this year, he placed himself in the middle of St.
  Mary's chancel, and spoke with an audible voice as followeth:</p>

  <p>"'Ornatissime Domine Procancellarie, vosque Domini Doctores
  pientissimi, quotquot me vel banniendum vel bannitionem meam ratam esse
  voluistis ut vobis omnibus et singulis innotescat discupio: me Henricum
  Whitwicke pileum coram Domino Vicecancellario Thoma Singleton capiti haud
  ita pridem imposuisse, quod nemini Magistrorum in Congregatione vel
  Convocatione [in presentia Domini Vicecancellarii aut Doctoris alicujus]
  licere fateor. Scitote quæso prætereà, me supradictum Henricum à
  sententia Domini Vicecancellarii ad venerabilem Domum Congregationis
  provocasse, quod nec licitum nec honestum esse in causa perturbationis
  pacis facilè concedo. Scitote denique me solum, manus Academicorum
  egregiè merentium Theologia Baccalaureorum et in Artibus Magistrorum in
  hac corona astantium Collegiatim et Aulatim cursitando rescripto
  apponendas curasse, in quibus omnibus Præfectis [summe] displicuisse, in
  pacem almæ hujus Academiæ et in dignissimum nostrum Procancellarium
  deliquisse, parum nolenti animo confiteor, et sanctitates vestras
  humillimè imploro, ut quæ vel temerè et inconsultò, vel volenter et
  scienter feci, ea, ut deceat homines, condonentur.</p>

  <p class="author">'<span class="sc">Henricus Wightwicke.</span>'</p>

  <p>Which submission or recognition being ended, he was restored to his
  former state, and so forthwith reassumed his place. But this person, who
  as lately beneficed at Kingerbury in Lincolnshire, could never be
  convinced, when he became Master of Pembroke College, forty-six years
  after this time, that he made any submission at all, but carried the
  business on and effected it against all the University; as to his young
  acquaintance that came often to visit him and he them (for he delighted
  in boyish company), he would, after a pedantical way, boast, supposing
  perhaps that, having been so many years before acted, no person could
  remember it; but record will rise up and justify matters when names and
  families are quite extirpated and forgotten among men. Pray see more of
  this cap-business in the year 1620."</p>

  <p>"1620.&mdash;In the beginning of Michaelmas Term following, the
  cap-business, mentioned an. 1614, was renewed again: for some
  disrelishment of the former transactions remaining behind, the Regent
  Masters met together several times for the effecting their designs. At
  length, after much ado, they drew up a petition subscribed by fifty-three
  of the senior Masters for this year, and presented it to one whom they
  knew would not be violent against them, as Dr. Singleton was before. The
  beginning of it runs thus:</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote class="b2n">

  <p>"'Reverendissimo Viro Domino Doctori Prideaux ornatissimo hujus
  Academiæ Vicecan. digniss, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>"'Multa jamjudum sunt (reverendissime Vicecancellarie) quæ ab antiquis
  hujus Academiæ institutis salubriter profecta, mala tandem consuetudo, et
  in pejus potens aut abrogavit penitus aut pessime corrupit, &amp;c.'</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Among those that subscribed to it were these following, that
  afterwards became persons of note, viz, Gilbert Sheldon, Alexand. Gill,
  jun., and Anthony Farndon, of Trinity Coll.; Pet. Heylin of Magd. Coll.
  [Robert Newlin of C. C. C., &amp;c.]. The chief solicitor of the business
  was Rous Clopton of Corpus Ch. Coll., a restless, busy person, and one
  afterwards as much noted for his infamy as any of the former for their
  learning or place. This petition, I say, being presented to Dr. Prideaux
  the Vicechancellor, and he considering well their several reasons for
  their sitting covered (one of which was that they were Judges in
  Congregations and Convocations), sent it to the Chancellor to have his
  consent, who also, after he had considered of it, wrote a letter to the
  Vicechancellor, to <!-- Page 132 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page132"></a>{132}</span>be communicated to the Convocation: the
  chief contents of which are these:</p>

</blockquote>

<blockquote class="b2n">

  <p>"'After my very harty commendations, I doe take this manner of
  proceeding by the Regent Masters (for their sitting covered at
  Congregations and Convocations) in soe good part, that although I might
  well take some time to advise before I give answer, especially when I
  consider how long that custom hath continued, how much it hath been
  questioned, and that upon a long debate it hath been withstood by so
  grave and wise a Counsellor of State as your late Chancellor, my
  immediate predecessor; yet, when I weigh their undoubted right, their
  discreet and orderly proceedings to seek it, not to take it, the chief,
  if not the only, cause why it was formerly denied; the good congruity
  this doth beare, not with Cambridge alone (though that were motive
  enough), but all other places, it being no where seen that those that are
  admitted Judges are required to sit bare-headed; I cannot choose but
  commend and thus farre yield to theire request as to referre it to the
  Convocation House. I hope no man can have cause to think that I have not
  the power to continew this custom as well as some others of my
  predecessors, if I had a mind to strive; nor that I seek after their
  applause in yielding them that now, which hath been so long kept from
  them, but the respect I have to their due, to the decency of the place,
  and honour of the University, which I cannot conceive to bee anyway
  diminished, but rather increased, by their sitting covered, are the only
  reasons that have moved me, and carried me to so quick a resolution,
  wherewith you may acquaint the Convocation House with this also, that
  what they shall conclude I shall willingly agree to. And soe I doe very
  hartely take leave, and rest</p>

  <p>Which letter being publickly read in a Convocation held 20 Dec., it
  was then agreed upon by the consent of all there present, that all
  Masters of what condition soever might put on their caps in Congregations
  and Convocations, yet with these conditions: That in the said assemblies
  the said Masters should use only square caps, and not sit bare, or
  without cap. And if any were found faulty in these matters, or that they
  should bring their hats in the said Assemblies, they should not only lose
  their suffrages for that time, but be punished as the Vicechancellor
  should think fit. Lastly, it was decreed, under the said conditions and
  no otherwise, that in the next Congregation in the beginning of Hilary
  Term, and so for ever after, all Masters, of what condition soever,
  whether Regents or not Regents, should, in Congregations and
  Convocations, put on and use square caps.</p>

  <p>"All that shall be said more of this matter is, that the loss of using
  caps arose from the negligence of the Masters, who, to avoid the pains of
  bringing their caps with them, would sit bare-headed; which being used by

  custom."</p>

  <p>It would seem, from Lord Pembroke's letter, that the right of the

<h3>RUSSIA, TURKEY, AND THE BLACK SEA.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. ix., p. 103.)</p>

  <p>Statements and complaints have often been made respecting the
  imperfect knowledge possessed by English navigators of the shores and
  coasts of the Black Sea, and of the great danger thence arising to ships
  and fleets from England, which would thus seem to be without the charts
  necessary for their guidance. <i>The Guardian</i> newspaper reiterates
  these complaints in its number for Jan. 11. This deficiency of charts,
  however, ought not to exist, and probably does not; since, no doubt, the
  English and French Governments would take care to supply them at the
  present time. As respects England, Dr. E. D. Clarke, in his well-known
  <i>Travels in Russia, &amp;c.</i> (see vol. i. 4th edit., 8vo., London,
  1816, Preface, p. x.), states that he brought&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Certain documents with him from Odessa, at the hazard of his life,
  and deposited within a British Admiralty."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>These documents, we are led naturally to infer, were charts; for he
  adds:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"They may serve to facilitate the navigation of the Russian coasts of
  the Black Sea, if ever the welfare of Great Britain should demand the
  presence of her fleets in that part of the world."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Happening to meet with this passage, in consulting Dr. Clarke's
  <i>Travels</i>, at the beginning of December, when the Fleets of Great
  Britain and France were on the point of entering the Black Sea, and
  having read in many quarters fears expressed for the fleets from the want
  of charts, I ventured to copy out the passage relating to these
  remarkable documents, and sent it to Lord Aberdeen; in case, from the
  alleged poverty of charts in the Admiralty Catalogues (see <i>The
  Guardian</i>, Jan. 11.), Dr. Clarke's "documents" should have fallen out
  of sight, and were forgotten. No notice, however, was taken of my
  communication; from which I concluded that it was wholly valueless.</p>

<h3>HIGH DUTCH AND LOW DUTCH.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. viii., pp. 478. 601.)</p>

  <p>If "N. &amp; Q." were the publication in which questions were
  cursorily settled, the answer of <span class="sc">James Spence
  Harry</span> (p. 478.) might suffice with regard to the Query of S. C. P.
  (p. 413.); but your correspondent E. C. H., who seems also <!-- Page 133
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page133"></a>{133}</span>to know
  something about the matter, wishes for German evidence.</p>

  <p>Should your correspondents <span class="sc">James S. Harry</span> and
  E. C. H. be acquainted (and I doubt not but they are) with the song, in
  which a German inquires "What is his native land?" and having called over
  some of the principalities, as Prussia, Suabia, Bavaria, Pomerania,
  Westphalia, Switzerland, Tyrol, he cries disdainfully, "No! no! no! my
  fatherland must be greater:" at last, despairing, he asks to name him
  that land, and is answered, "Wherever the German tongue is
  heard:"&mdash;should <span class="sc">James S. Harry</span> and E. C. H.
  recollect these words, they will conceive that such a people must have
  several tribes, and each tribe their peculiar dialect, founded on
  prescribed rules, and to which individually equal justice is due.</p>

  <p>The dialects of the Deutsche Sprache, the German language, are the
  Ober Deutsche and Nieder Deutsche, Upper German and Low German: from the
  former dialect has, in course of time, proceeded the Hoch Deutsche
  Sprache, the High German language, now used exclusively as the book
  language by the more educated classes throughout Germany.</p>

  <p>The principal dialects of the Ober Deutsche are the following:</p>

  <p>1. The Allemanic, spoken in Switzerland and the Upper Rhine.</p>

  <p>2. The Suabian, spoken in the countries between the Black Forest and
  the River Lech.</p>

  <p>3. The Bavarian, spoken in the South of Bavaria and Austria.</p>

  <p>4. The Franconian, spoken in the North of Bavaria, Hessen, and the
  Middle Rhine.</p>

  <p>5. The Upper Saxon or Misnian, spoken in the plains of Saxony and
  Thüringia.</p>

  <p>These dialects differ from each other, and particularly from the High
  German language, with regard to their elements.</p>

  <p>The Ober Deutsche dialects differ from each other by the introduction
  of peculiar vowels.</p>

  <p>The Nieder Deutsche is distinguished from the Ober Deutsche by the
  shifting of consonants: <i>ex. gr.</i>:</p>

<h3>PHOTOGRAPHIC CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>

  <p><span class="sc">Dr. Mansell</span> having forwarded to me for
  publication the accompanying account of his mode of operation, I have
  much pleasure in laying it before the readers of "N. &amp; Q.;" because
  my friend <span class="sc">Dr. Mansell</span> is not only so fortunate in
  his results, but is one of the most careful and correct manipulators in
  our art. The proportions which he recommends, and his mode of operating,
  are, it will be seen, somewhat different from those hitherto published.
  In writing to me he says: "I make a point of making a short note in the
  evening of the day's experiments, a plan involving very little trouble,
  but of great service as a reference." If all photographers would adopt
  this simple plan, how much good would result! <span class="sc">Dr.
  M.</span> complains to me of the constant variation he has found in
  collodion; (with your permission, I will in your pages furnish him, and
  all your readers with some plain directions on this point); and he has
  given me some excellent observations on the "fashionable" waxed-paper
  process, in which he has not met with such good results as he had
  anticipated; although with much experience which <i>may</i> some day turn
  to good account. <span class="sc">Dr. Mansell</span> concludes with an
  observation in which I entirely concur, viz. "That the calotype process
  is by far the most useful; and I find the pictures it gives have better
  effect than the wax ones, which always to me appear flat, even when they
  are not gravelly."</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">H. W. Diamond.</span></p>

  <p><i>The Calotype on the Sea-shore.</i>&mdash;The great quantity of blue
  light reflected from the sea renders calotyping in its vicinity much more
  difficult than in the country; the more distant the object, the greater
  depth has the blue veil which floats over it, and as a consequence of
  this disproportion, if time enough is given in the camera to bring out
  the foreground, the sky becomes red, and the distance obscured. After
  constant failures with papers iodized in the usual manner, I made a
  number of experiments to obtain a paper that would stand the camera long
  enough to satisfy the required conditions, and the result was the
  following method, which gives an intensity of blacks and half-tones, with
  a solidity and uniform depth over large portions of sky, greater than I
  have seen produced by any other process. Since I adopted it, in the
  autumn of 1852, I have scarcely had a failure, and this success induces
  me to recommend it to those who, like myself, work in highly actinising
  localities.</p>

  <p>The object of the following plan is to impregnate the paper evenly
  with a strong body of iodide of silver. I prefer iodizing by the single
  process, and for this purpose use a strong solution of iodide of silver,
  as the paper when finished ought to have, as nearly as possible, the
  colour of pure iodide of silver.</p>

  <p>Take 100 grains of nitrate of silver, and 100 grains of iodide of
  potassium<a name="footnotetag4" href="#footnote4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>,
  dissolve each in two ounces of distilled water, pour the iodide solution
  into the nitrate of silver, wash the precipitate in three distilled
  waters, pour off the fluid, and dissolve it in a solution of iodide of
  potassium, about 680 grains are required, making the whole up to four
  ounces.</p>

  <p>Having cut the paper somewhat larger than the picture, turn up the
  edges so as to form a dish, and placing it on a board, pour into it the
  iodide solution abundantly, guiding it equally over the surface with a
  camel-hair pencil; continue to wave it to and fro for five minutes, then
  pour off the surplus, which serves over and over again, and after
  dripping the paper, lay it to dry on a round surface, so that it dries
  equally fast all over; when almost dry it is well to give it a sight of
  the fire, to finish off those parts which remain wet longest, but not
  more than <i>just to surface dry it</i>.</p>

  <p>Immerse it in common rain-water, often changing it, and in about
  twenty minutes all the iodide of potash is removed. To ascertain this,
  take up some of the last water in a glass, and add to it a few drops of a
  strong solution of bichloride of mercury in alcohol, the least trace of
  hydriodate of potash is detected by a precipitate of iodide of mercury. A
  solution of nitrate of silver is no test whatever unless distilled water
  is used, as ordinary water almost invariably contains muriates. The
  sooner the washing is over the better. Pin up the paper to drip, and
  finish drying before a slow fire, turning it. If hung up to dry by a
  corner, the parts longest wet are always weaker than those that dry
  first. When dry pass a nearly cold iron over the back, to smooth it; if
  well made it has a fine primrose colour, and is perfectly even by
  transmitted light.</p>

  <p>To excite the paper, take distilled water two drachms, drop into it
  four drops (not minims) of saturated solution of gallic acid, and eight
  drops (not minims) of the aceto-nitrate solution; mix. Always dilute the
  gallic acid by dropping it into the water before the aceto-nitrate;
  gallate of silver is less readily formed, and the paper keeps longer in
  hot weather. If the temperature is under sixty degrees, use five drops of
  gallic acid, and ten of aceto-nitrate; if above seventy degrees, use only
  three drops of gallic acid, and seven of aceto-nitrate. The aceto-nitrate
  solution consists of nitrate of silver fifty grains, glacial acetic acid
  two drachms, distilled water one ounce.</p>

  <p>Having pinned the paper by two adjacent corners to a deal board, the
  eighth of an inch smaller on each side than it is, to prevent the
  solutions getting to the back, lay on the gallo-nitrate abundantly with a
  soft cotton brush (made by wedging a portion of fine cotton into a cork);
  and keep the solution from pooling, by using the brush with a very light
  hand. In about two minutes the paper has imbibed it evenly, and lies
  dead; blot it up, and allow it to dry in a box, or place it at once in
  the paper-holder. For fear of stains on the <!-- Page 135 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page135"></a>{135}</span>back, it is better to
  place on the board a clean sheet of ordinary paper for every picture. It
  is very important to have the glass, in which the gallo-nitrate is made,
  <i>chemically</i> clean; every time it is used, it should be washed with
  strong nitric acid, and then with distilled water.</p>

  <p>To develop:&mdash;Pin the paper on the board as before; rapidly brush
  over it a solution of gallo-nitrate, as used to excite. As soon as the
  picture appears, in about a minute, pour on a saturated solution of
  gallic acid abundantly, and keep it from pooling with the brush, using it
  with a very light hand. In about ten minutes the picture is fully
  developed. If very slow in coming out, a few drops of pure aceto-nitrate
  brushed over the surface will rapidly bring out the picture; but this is
  seldom required, and it will sometimes brown the whites. It is better, as
  soon as the gallic acid has been applied, to put the picture away from
  the light of the candle in a box or drawer, there to develop quietly,
  watching its progress every three or four minutes; the surface is to be
  refreshed by a few light touches of the brush, adding more gallic acid if
  necessary. Many good negatives are spoiled by over-fidgetting in this
  part of the process. When the picture is fully out, wash, &amp;c. as
  usual; the iodide of silver is rapidly removed by a saturated solution of
  hyposulphite of soda, which acts much less on the weaker blacks than it
  does if diluted.</p>

  <p>If the picture will not develop, from too short exposure in the
  camera, a solution of pyrogallic acid, as <span class="sc">Dr.
  Diamond</span> recommends, after the gallic acid has done its utmost,
  greatly increases the strength of the blacks: it slightly reddens the
  whites, but not in the same ratio that it deepens the blacks.</p>

  <p>After the first wash with gallo-nitrate, it is essential to develop
  these strongly iodized papers with gallic acid only: the half-and-half
  mixture of aceto-nitrate and gallic acid, which works well with weaker
  papers, turns these red.</p>

  <p>The paper I use is Whatman's 1849. Turner's paper, Chafford Mills, if
  two or three years old, answers equally well.</p>

  <p>[Having lately prepared this solution according to the formula given
  by <i>Dr. Diamond</i> (Vol. viii., p. 597.), in which it required 650
  grains to dissolve the 60-grain precipitate, we were inclined to think
  our correspondent had formed a wrong calculation, as the difference
  appeared so little for a solution more than one-third stronger. We found
  upon <i>accurately</i> following <span class="sc">Dr. Mansell's</span>

  effect a solution, whilst we have at the same time dissolved the quantity
  recommended by <span class="sc">Dr. Diamond</span> with 598 grains. This
  little experiment is a useful lesson to our correspondents, exhibiting as

  stoat, but says that it is the "smallest animal of the weasel tribe, and
  pursues the smallest prey.") It would be of much use, both to naturalists
  and others, if our zoological works would give the popular provincial
  names of animals and birds; collectors might then more easily procure
  specimens from labourers, &amp;c. I have formed a list of Norfolk names

  <p><i>Celtic Etymology</i> (Vol. ix., p. 40.).&mdash;If the <i>h</i> must
  be "exhasperated" (as Matthews used to say) in words adopted into the
  English language, how does it happen that we never hear it in
  <i>hour</i>, <i>honour</i>, <i>heir</i>, <i>honest</i>, and
  <i>humour</i>? Will E. C. H. be so kind as to inform me on this point?
  With regard to the word <i>humble</i>, in support of the <i>h</i> being
  silent, I have seen it stated in a dictionary, but by whom I cannot call
  to mind, in a list of words nearly spelled alike, and whose sound is the
  same:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"<span class="sc">Humble</span>, low, submissive."</p>
      <p class="hg3">"<span class="sc">Umbles</span>, the entrails of a deer."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Hence the point of the sarcasm "He will be made to eat <i>humble</i>
  pie;" and it serves in this instance to show that the <i>h</i> is silent
  when the word is properly pronounced.</p>

  <p>The two words <i>isiol</i> and <i>irisiol</i>, properly
  <i>uirisiol</i>, which E. C. H. has stated to be the original Celtic
  words signifying <i>humble</i>, have quite a different meaning: for
  <i>isiol</i> is quietly, silently, without noise; and <i>uirisiol</i>
  means, sneaking, cringing, crawling, terms which could not be applied
  without injustice to a really humble honest person. The
  Iberno-Ph&oelig;nician <i>umal</i> bears in itself evidence that it is
  not borrowed from any other language, for the two syllables are
  intelligible apart from each other; and the word can be at once reduced
  to its root <i>um</i>, to which the Sanscrit word <i>kshama</i>, as given
  by E. C. H., bears no resemblance whatever.</p>

  the author discovered the error, and made a clumsy effort to rectify it;

  <p>The following curiosity of literature lately appeared in the London
  papers, in a biographical notice of the late Viscount Beresford, which is
  inserted in the <i>Naval and Military Gazette</i> of January 14,
  1854:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Of honorary badges he had, first, A cross dependent from seven

  honorary distinctions to all the survivors of the great war, Lord
  Beresford received the <i>Peninsular</i> medal, with two clasps, for
  <i>Egypt</i> and Ciudad Rodrigo."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The expression should have been "the silver medal," not "Peninsular;"
  as, among the names of battles engraved on the clasps attached to the
  silver war-medals, granted in 1849, will be found the words "Martinique,"
  "Fort Détroit," "Chateauguay," "Chrystler's Farm," and "Egypt."</p>

  <p>This copy seems to have at one time belonged to Longmans, as it is

  "Orator Henly," "Ritson," and "J. Park." I have read this volume over

  <i>Handbook of London</i>, or <span class="sc">Dr. Rimbault</span>, would
  mislead any one, I am afraid my copy, being a second edition, may be
  incomplete; and as I certainly did not get the volume for <i>nothing</i>,
  will either of these gentlemen, or any other of the readers of "N. &amp;

  <p><i>Brydone the Tourist's Birth-place</i> (Vol. vii., p.
  108.).&mdash;According to Chambers's <i>Lives of Scotsmen</i>, vol. i. p.
  384., 1832, Brydone was the son of a clergyman in the neighbourhood of
  Dumbarton, where he was born in the year 1741. When he came to England,
  he was engaged as travelling preceptor by Mr. Beckford, to whom his
  <i>Tour through Sicily and Malta</i> is addressed. In a copy of this
  work, now before me, I find the following remarks written in pencil:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"These travels are written in a very plausible style, but little
  dependence is to be placed upon their veracity. Brydone never was on the
  summit of Ætna, although he describes the prospect from it in such
  glowing colours."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It is right to add, that the writer of these remarks was long a
  resident in Italy, and in constant habits of intercourse with the most
  distinguished scholars of that country.</p>

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, ETC.</h3>

  <p>The second volume of <i>Murray's British Classics</i>, which is also
  the second of Mr. Cunningham's edition of <i>The Works of Oliver
  Goldsmith</i>, fully justifies all we said in commendation of its
  predecessor. It contains Goldsmith's <i>Enquiry into the State of Polite
  Literature in Europe</i>, and his admirable series of letters, entitled
  <i>The Citizen of the World</i>. Mr. Cunningham tells us that "he has
  been careful to mark all Goldsmith's own notes with his name;" his
  predecessors having in some instances adopted them as their own, and in
  others omitted them altogether, although they are at times curiously
  illustrative of the text. We are glad to see that Mr. Murray announces a
  new edition, revised and greatly enlarged, of Mr. Foster's valuable
  <i>Life of Goldsmith</i>, uniform with the present collection of
  Goldsmith's writings.</p>

  <p><i>Memorials of the Canynges Family and their Times; Westbury College,
  Redcliffe Church, and Chatterton</i>, by George Pryce, is the somewhat
  abbreviated title of a goodly octavo volume, on which Mr. Pryce has
  bestowed great industry and research, and by which he hopes to clear away
  the mists of error which have overshadowed the story of the Canynges
  family during the Middle Ages, and to show their connexion with the
  erection or restoration of Westbury College and Redcliff Church. As Mr.
  Pryce has some few inedited memoranda relating to Chatterton, he has done
  well to incorporate them in a volume dedicated in some measure to the
  history of Bristol's "Merchant Prince."</p>

  <p><i>Poetical Works of Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey, Minor
  Contemporaneous Poets, and Thomas Sackville, Lord Buckhurst</i>, edited
  by Robert Bell, forms the second volume of Parker's <i>Annotated Edition
  of the British Poets</i>. Availing himself, very properly, of the labours
  of his predecessors, Mr. Bell has given us very agreeable and valuable
  memoirs of Surrey and Buckhurst; and we have no doubt that this cheap
  edition of their works will be the means of putting them into the hands
  of many readers to whom they were before almost entirely unknown.</p>

  <p>The Library Committee of the Society of Antiquaries, having had under
  their consideration the state of the engraved portraits in the possession
  of the Society, consulted one of the Fellows, Mr. W. Smith, as to the
  best mode of arrangement. That gentleman, having gone through the
  collection, advised that in future the Society should chiefly direct its
  attention to the formation of a series of <i>engraved Portraits of the
  Fellows</i>, and with great liberality presented about one hundred and
  fifty such portraits as his contribution towards such collection. Mr.
  Smith's notion is certainly a very happy one: and we mention that and his
  very handsome donation, in hopes of thereby rendering as good service to
  the Society's Collection of Portraits, as we are glad to learn has been
  rendered to their matchless Series of Proclamations by our occasional
  notices of them.</p>
